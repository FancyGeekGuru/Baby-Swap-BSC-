## As a Project

## USDT route
Unlike other AMM decentralized exchanges on Binance Smart Chain, our recommended swap route is USDT, not BNB or BUSD. Arbitrage between BabySwap and other DEXs or CEXs can cost way lower.

BabySwap runs on Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.
